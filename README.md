# Standard-Naive-Bayes-Classifier
Implementation of Standard Naive Bayes Classifier (SNB Classifier) using cross-validation for test accuracy. I used a dataclean() function to improve the test accuracy, this is validated using cross validation.

To run: 
1. Create folder 'datasets' and add the tst.csv and trg.csv files into it as well as the .ipynb file
2. Run the jupyter file
